"""
STEP 2 OF 4 -- Signal Detector
==============================
Receives every candle close from Step 1 (CandleEngine).
Checks S2 entry conditions.
Emits SignalEvent objects when a valid trade setup is found.

STRATEGY 2 -- FVG Retest + EMA 50/100 + ADX  (LONG + SHORT)
  Three-candle Fair Value Gap forms      -> tracked
  Price retests FVG zone                 (depth <=70%, age <=20 bars)
  Confirmation candle closes:
    - body >=50% of range (impulse)
    - close above/below BOTH EMA50 and EMA100
    - EMA50 above/below EMA100 (trend alignment)
    - ADX(14) >= 20
    - either continuation (allowContinuation=ON) or fresh break across EMA50
  Entry: NEXT candle's open (handled by order manager via market order at signal time)
  SL: 0.5% from entry. TP: 1.0% from entry (RR = 2.0).
  Lock Profit: when price reaches 50% of TP distance, SL is moved to entry+10% of TP
               distance (i.e. the trade can no longer lose -- it locks in 10% profit).

  One trade per symbol at a time. New signals blocked while a trade is open.

How it connects:
  from step2_signal_detector import SignalDetector, SignalEvent
  detector = SignalDetector()
  engine   = CandleEngine(SYMBOLS, callback=detector.on_candle_close)
  engine.start()

  detector.on_signal = my_handler   # called with (SignalEvent,)

Logic parity:
  This file is a 1:1 port of BacktestZair_S2_only.py's signal-generation logic.
  The FVG state machine, retest detection, confirmation logic, and trigger order
  are identical. The only difference is that the backtest knows the next candle's
  open at signal time (because it has the full series), while the live bot fires
  a market order on signal-candle close -- the order manager fills at current
  market price, which IS the next candle's open in real time.
